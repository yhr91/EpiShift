Predicting Alzheimers from epigenetic data

- Supervised contains scripts used for fully supervised training on 1D convolutional neural networks. This was used to generate the results that are cited in the paper
- Self-supervised contains exploratory work performed using self-supervised pretraining to further improve model performance. The results here were inconclusive and so this method was not discussed in the paper
